The process is quite easy:

Whenever you find some video worth downloading just open the terminal and type this command:
$echo "<youtube-link>" >> /PathToFile/download.txt

Repeat above command as much as you like.
Once you are full with your bucket list you can view it in download.txt 
Now to download just type in command line 
$python /Youtube_bulk_Downloader/bd.py

Downloads will begin and you can track the progress in the commandline

Don't worry of duplicate downloads they are taken care of.
